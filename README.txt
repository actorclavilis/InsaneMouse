InsaneMouse (working title, since it may wind up to not be a mouse game at all)

Currently being developed by Harrison Houghton and Sharan Juangphanich as an extension of a school project. Concept is simple: dodge enemies which try to block your cursor in. Very simple (as of now) but hopefully will eventually get an iPad port.

With the MP3: Move javazoom.jar and Tonic.mp3 into the same directory as the final jar for it to work.
