InsaneMouse (working title, since it may wind up to not be a mouse game at all)

Currently being developed by Harrison Houghton and Sharan Juangphanich as an extension of a school project. Concept is simple: dodge enemies which try to block your cursor in. Very simple (as of now) but hopefully will eventually get an iPad port.

MP3: Add javazoom.jar to libraries and move Tonic.mp3 to root project folder. (located in z_addToRoot)
IMAGE: Add howTo.png and menuBackground.png to root project folder. (located in z_addToRoot)
