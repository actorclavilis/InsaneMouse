InsaneMouse (working title, since it may wind up to not be a mouse game at all)

Currently being developed by Harrison Houghton and Sharan Juangphanich as an extension of a school project. Concept is simple: dodge enemies which try to block your cursor in. Very simple (as of now) but hopefully will eventually get an iPad port.

NOTE to pushers (Sharan): The work cycle goes like this: pull, edit, commit, push. Whenever you start working, pull. Whenever you finish for a length of time or reach a milestone, commit and push. If you do this properly we will not have fastforward errors.
